\section{Anonymous Credentials with Aggregatable Presentations} \label{sec:acap}
To model the security of our ACAP scheme, we will define Syntax following the lines of other anonymous credential constructions \cite{DBLP:conf/eurocrypt/TessaroZ23a}. Further, we will formally define the security properties we aim to achieve. We present syntax for two kinds of presentation proofs for full and partial disclosure of attributes. These proofs can be combined using an aggregation algorithm $\Aggr$ and we define security properties incorporating this change.
